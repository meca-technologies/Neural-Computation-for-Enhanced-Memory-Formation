# Neural-Computation-for-Enhanced-Memory-Formation
Machine learning proposition that outlines how to capture logical aspects of neural computation and memory formation.

#Introduction:
For example, modern neural networks do a very poor job of reproducing logical computations, and they are not very good at accounting for the logical properties of thoughts and memories in terms of just the lower-level principles of learning and neural activity.

Motivation for integrating logical inference with neural computation to address these limitations.

The importance of the ability to form memory in machine-learning systems for certain tasks where long-term reasoning and complex decision-making are required.
